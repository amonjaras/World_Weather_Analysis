## **1. Overview**

The PlanMyTrip company requires the data analysis to recommend ideal hotels based on weather preferences. To perform this analysis we will need to answer the question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? So, what is the meaning of "ideal."
1. Hotels will be within a given range of latitude and longitude
2. Will provide the right kind of weather for the client.

### **1.1 Project Plan**
- [x] Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide
- [x] Explanatory Analysis with Visualization
- [x] Visualize Travel Data
- [x] Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## **4. Summary**
We were able to generate a list of around 600 cities around the world, the list includes the following information:

- City_ID
- City
- Country
- Maximum Temperature in Â°F
- Current Weather Description
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Hotel Name

After all the analysis, PlanMyTrip was happy with the results, allowing potential customers to select their travel destination based on temperature preferences.

Below some examples of how the analysis is presented to final customer:
